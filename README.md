# BAJI_2022
Data analysis requests from BAJI &amp; IRC, NYU Law School

## Intro:
This page hosts all the analytical documents of the data analysis pertaining to requests from the Immigrant Rights Clinic(IRC), NYU in 2022. The requests are based on two separate datasets and therefore the analytical documents (description and codes) are listed separately. The file `EOIR_request` and `Census_request` include detailed descriptions and the **R & Stata** codes that produced the results. The purposes of these documents is to offer descriptions of how each request was fullfilled analytically and allow for replicability with the original and identical data. 

## Data sources:
**Census data**: ACS-5 year estimate files and Microsample Public Use files of 2015 and 2019: https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/

**EOIR data**: Department of Justice publishes data on immigration court & cases: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/foia-library-0
